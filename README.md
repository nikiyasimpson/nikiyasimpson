![Busy Woman using a lot of technology](/images/hero.png)

I'm excited about learning new technology and applying it to making lives better. I currently work with ASP.NET/C# development and working on React Native projects. I'm also interested in learning on how to incorporate Machine Learning and AI into applications.

I also teach SQL on LinkedIn (expected to release December 2020)

I'm currently focused on growing the GDG Little Rock and Women Techmaker Community in Arkansas to empower women and people working in tech in non-tech companies. Always looking for speakers that love to share their experiences and expertise.
